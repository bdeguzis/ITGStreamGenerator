# ITGStreamGenerator
Auto-generation for In The Groove stream patterns


Assuming you are farmiliar with In the Groove and the Stamina sub-genere therewithin.

This program modifies a .SM file, chaning all instances of "1000" to random combinations of 1 and three 0's. The idea being that
you place notes in the left column where you would like stream patterns to be generated, and then the program does the rest. 
It doesn't completely automate the file making process, but if you don't care about pitch relevance or patterns going to the music 
then this will hopefully make things easier. 
The program also attempts to make these patterns comfortable, as defined by what I have gathered to be acceptable patterns
from both my experience and from input of other ITG stamina players. 
Obviously if you're looking for high quality stamina charts, look elsewhere. But if you just want to quickly make a bunch of dump 
charts to your favorite tunes, this should do the trick.

I am fully aware that ArrowVortex already accomplishes this. However, it doesn't do everything I want it to so I'm making
my own. I would just modify what ArrowVortex has but it's not open source for some reason so *shrug*
(Also if Box releases his file generator, then I guess this was good coding practice).
